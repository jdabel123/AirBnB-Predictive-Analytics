<h3> Introduction </h3>

<div>
  <p>
    For this project i completed an analysis of Seattle Airbnb listings, which the dataset is available on kaggle <a href="url">link here</a>. I focused solely on the listings.csv dataset, which included information about 38000 listings. I used a Jupyter Notebook to complete this analysis and can be found in the Udacity Project 1.ipynb file.
  </p>
 <p>
   I focused my analysis on answering the following questions:
   
   <ol>
    <li>Do guests value hosts with Superhost status?</li>
    <li>How does charging a cleaning fee affect the listing price and demand?</li>
   <li>How important is the property type in relation to listing price?</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  In my analysis i have also created a linear regression model to try and predict the listing price.
